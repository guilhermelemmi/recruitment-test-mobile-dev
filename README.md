# Mobile Dev Recruitment Test

This is a test to qualify for the Mobile Dev Position.

The platform, language and hard deadline will be sent to you in an invitation email.

Fork this repo to start development.

Your goal is to implement a BMI calculator mobile app (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) .

- Target the best user experience.
- Make it look good (or acceptable).

After the deadline, the reviewers will clone your forked repo and checkout the last eligible commit (the last one before the deadline) in the master branch.
We will only follow the instructions you leave in this README.md file to build and run the project, please be straight and clear.
In case we are not able to run the code you deliver, your efforts won't be considered as an acceptable outcome.

If we succeed in running your project, we will consider your approach in solving the problem as a tiebreaker with other candidates, so please, commit small steps very often so we can understand your performance an ability in breaking down your goal into smaller problems.

Good Luck!
