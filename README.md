# BMI Calculator
BMI calculator is a mobile app that can calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a given person, using the weight and height of that person as variables in the formula: BMI = weight / (height^2). The BMI value is then used to classify that person as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight or Obese (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index ).
